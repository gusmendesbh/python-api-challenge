# Background

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. Using what has been learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.”

In this deliverable, it was created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Using the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

This model should help proving the correlation between geolocation and weather.
